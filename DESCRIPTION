Description: Provides two integrated statistical models for survey-based
    catch-at-length stock assessment built on the Template Model Builder (TMB)
    framework. The ACL (Age-structured Catch-at-Length) model tracks populations
    in age space and projects catch into length space via a proportion-at-length-
    given-age matrix. The ALSCL (Age-and-Length-Structured Catch-at-Length) model
    maintains a full three-dimensional population array across length, age, and
    year, with fishing mortality operating directly on length classes through a
    growth transition matrix. Both models are particularly suited for hard-to-age
    fisheries stocks where length is the primary observation. The package includes
    multi-start optimization with optional parallel computing, simulation testing,
    retrospective analysis with Mohn's rho, a comprehensive suite of diagnostic
    visualization functions, and a model comparison framework for rigorous
    evaluation of alternative model structures.
