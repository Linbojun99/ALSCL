# Model principles

The ALSCL package provides an age-structured model (ACL) and a joint age–length model (ALSCL) for survey catch-at-length assessment. The framework follows [Zhang & Cadigan (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1111/faf.12673), with time units and random-effect parameterization stated explicitly below.

### Population dynamics


Let $`i=1,\ldots,A`$ index age classes, with actual age $`a_i=a_{rec}+(i-1)\Delta t`$, and let $`t`$ index model steps. ACL advances survivors by age, introduces recruitment in the first class, and retains survivors in the oldest plus group:

```math
N_{1,t}=R_t,\qquad Z_{i,t}=M+F_{i,t},
```

```math
N_{i+1,t+1}=N_{i,t}\exp(-Z_{i,t}),\qquad i=1,\ldots,A-2,
```

```math
N_{A,t+1}=N_{A-1,t}\exp(-Z_{A-1,t})+N_{A,t}\exp(-Z_{A,t}).
```


M and F are instantaneous rates **per model step**. A quarterly model uses `growth_step=0.25` and quarterly mortality rates; growth parameter $`k`$ is annual.

### Fishing mortality structure


ACL estimates F by age, whereas ALSCL estimates F by length. With $`s`$ denoting the corresponding age or length class, both use separable AR(1) × AR(1) deviations in log F:

```math
F_{s,t}=\exp(\mu_F+d_{s,t}),\qquad
\mathrm{Cov}(d_{s,t},d_{s-h,t-j})=\sigma_F^2\phi_S^{|h|}\phi_T^{|j|}.
```


Here $`\sigma_F`$ is the **marginal SD** in TMB's scaled, separable AR(1) density. The correlation parameters describe dependence across groups and time. Innovation-variance parameterizations use a different scaling; dividing this expression again by two $`1-\phi^2`$ factors would be incorrect. Natural mortality M is supplied as known.

### Recruitment


The fitted models use AR(1) log recruitment deviations. The following stationary representation uses marginal SD $`\sigma_R`$:

```math
R_t=\exp(\mu_R+r_t),\qquad
r_1\sim N(0,\sigma_R^2),\qquad
r_{t+1}=\phi_R r_t+\eta_t,\quad
\eta_t\sim N\!\left(0,\sigma_R^2(1-\phi_R^2)\right).
```


$`\exp(\mu_R)`$ is the median recruitment scale, not the arithmetic mean including stochastic variation. The full `sim_data()` operating model uses Beverton–Holt stock–recruitment with random deviations; its recruitment process differs from the fitted model.

### Initial conditions


Initial recruitment defines the youngest class; older classes follow a recursive decline with an initial mortality rate and class-to-class deviations:

```math
\log N_{1,1}=\log R_1,\qquad
\log N_{i,1}=\log N_{i-1,1}-Z_{init}+u_{i-1},\quad
u_{i-1}\sim N(0,\sigma_{N0}^2).
```


Thus the initial log abundance contains the cumulative sum of earlier class deviations. The total deviations at different ages are not independent. ALSCL allocates these initial numbers across length using age–length probabilities.

### Age-to-length conversion (ACL)


Length conditional on age follows a normal distribution whose mean is defined by the von Bertalanffy curve:

```math
\mu_i=L_\infty\left[1-e^{-k(a_i-t_0)}\right],\qquad
\sigma_i=CV_L\mu_i,
```

```math
p_{l|i}=\Phi\!\left(\frac{UB_l-\mu_i}{\sigma_i}\right)
       -\Phi\!\left(\frac{LB_l-\mu_i}{\sigma_i}\right),\qquad
N_{l,t}=\sum_i p_{l|i}N_{i,t}.
```


`pla` is the age–length probability matrix shown by `plot_pla()`. Differentiable normal CDF differences, symmetric right-tail calculations and normalization provide the implemented numerical treatment. Boundaries must match survey bins. Appendix S1 describes a fixed-order Taylor approximation; the package uses the CDF formulation above.

### Growth transition matrix (ALSCL)


ALSCL retains length, age and time in $`N_{l,i,t}`$. Entry $`G_{j,l}`$ is the probability of moving from source length bin $`l`$ to destination bin $`j`$. Survival and growth for ordinary age classes follow:

```math
N_{j,i+1,t+1}=\sum_l G_{j,l}N_{l,i,t}\exp[-(M+F_{l,t})].
```


The plus group combines survivors and growth from the preceding and oldest age classes. Recruitment enters the youngest class with its length distribution. Columns of G sum to one, shrinkage is excluded, and the largest bin absorbs right-tail probability. Growth can still leave an individual within its original bin.


Growth increments use the following smooth decreasing mean, with SD $`CV_G\mu_{\Delta L}`$:

```math
\mu_{\Delta L}(L)=\frac{\Delta t(1-e^{-k})L_\infty}
{1+\exp\!\left(-\log(19)\frac{L-0.5L_\infty}{0.05L_\infty-0.5L_\infty}\right)}.
```


This is not the exact arbitrary-step VB increment $`(L_\infty-L)(1-e^{-k\Delta t})`$. `pla` describes length given age, while G describes a one-step transition given source length. They are not interchangeable. `FL` is length-specific F; `FA` is derived from original-cohort survival.

### Derived quantities


Mean individual weight $`w_{l,t}`$ and maturity proportion $`m_{l,t}`$ convert abundance into length-specific biomass, spawning biomass and totals:

```math
b_{l,t}=N_{l,t}w_{l,t},\qquad sb_{l,t}=b_{l,t}m_{l,t},\qquad
B_t=\sum_l b_{l,t},\qquad SSB_t=\sum_l sb_{l,t}.
```


`CN` and `CB` are derived fishery catch numbers and biomass, distinct from the input survey number index. Biomass units depend on weight units and the abundance scale.

### Survey observations


Let $`I_{l,t}`$ denote the survey number index and $`N_{l,t}`$ population abundance. Survey observations follow a lognormal model:

```math
\log I_{l,t}=\log q_l+\log N_{l,t}+\epsilon_{l,t},\qquad
\epsilon_{l,t}\sim N(0,\sigma_I^2),
```

```math
q_l=\left[1+\exp\!\left(-\log(19)\frac{L_l-L_{50}}{L_{95}-L_{50}}\right)\right]^{-1}.
```


`sel_L50` and `sel_L95` fix survey catchability at 0.5 and 0.95 at the specified lengths; they are not estimated fishery selectivity. Absolute abundance depends on q, M and related assumptions. `exp(report$Elog_index)` is the original-scale median; the arithmetic mean also includes $`\exp(\sigma_I^2/2)`$.

### Estimation and uncertainty


TMB uses automatic differentiation and a Laplace approximation for random effects; R's `nlminb()` optimizes fixed effects. `sdreport()` obtains approximate standard errors from local curvature and the delta method. Plotted 95% intervals are pointwise, and parameters held fixed do not contribute estimation uncertainty.

## From latent state to survey observation

| Process | Role |
|---|---|
| Recruitment, survival and growth | Update the population state |
| Numbers at length × survey catchability | Predict the survey index |
| Observation error | Relates predictions to survey observations |
| Numbers × weight × maturity | Derive biomass and spawning biomass |


Survey numbers constrain latent population states; weights, maturity and survival define derived quantities. Fishery catch `CN` is not the survey input. `plot_CatL()` shows observations and fitted survey indices.

## Two different probability matrices

|Matrix|Meaning|Check|
|---|---|---|
| `pla` |Length given age; simulator orientation varies|Check orientation|
| `G` |Destination row conditional on source column|Nonnegative, normalized, no shrinkage|


`plot_pla()` shows age-length probabilities. The tuna ALSCL growth matrix below instead shows the probabilities of staying in a bin or advancing to larger bins.

![Growth transition](https://github.com/Linbojun99/ALSCL/blob/main/docs/figures/cases/tuna_growth_transition.png?raw=true)

```r
# b is an ALSCL fit
G <- b$report$G
range(colSums(G))
stopifnot(all(G >= 0), max(abs(colSums(G) - 1)) < 1e-8)
```


Growth can remain within the same bin; this is bin retention, not zero individual growth. The largest bin absorbs the right tail. Changing bin boundaries changes both matrices and state interpretation.

## Uncertainty and identifiability


TMB `sdreport` uses local curvature and the delta method. Approximate 95% pointwise intervals are not simultaneous bands. Growth intervals represent parameter uncertainty in the mean curve, not individual-fish prediction ranges.


YTF fixes growth and selected process parameters. Its growth interval can collapse to a line, and other intervals are conditional on these fixed values. Investigate Hessian, bounds and gradients before interpreting intervals.

## Annual and quarterly units


Ages use the stated step. Growth k is annual; M and F are instantaneous rates per model step. Annual M = 0.8 becomes quarterly M = 0.2. Survival is exponential, not a direct subtraction of rates from abundance.

```r
rec.age <- .25; nage <- 20; growth_step <- .25
ages <- rec.age + (seq_len(nage) - 1) * growth_step
range(ages) # years
M_quarter <- .8 * growth_step
# Sum four quarterly instantaneous rates
F_quarter <- c(.1, .15, .2, .15)
F_annual <- sum(F_quarter)
```


`plot_compare_annual_F()` does not annualize quarterly values. Apical is a within-step group maximum; mean is unweighted. Native F dimensions differ between models.
