\title{ALSCL: Age-and-Length-Structured Catch-at-Length Stock Assessment Models}
\description{
Provides two integrated statistical models for survey-based catch-at-length stock assessment built on the Template Model Builder (TMB) framework. The ACL (Age-structured Catch-at-Length) model tracks populations in age space and projects catch into length space via a proportion-at-length- given-age matrix. The ALSCL (Age-and-Length-Structured Catch-at-Length) model maintains a full three-dimensional population array across length, age, and year, with fishing mortality operating directly on length classes through a growth transition matrix. Both models are particularly suited for hard-to-age fisheries stocks where length is the primary observation. The package includes multi-start optimization with optional parallel computing, simulation testing, retrospective analysis with Mohn's rho, a comprehensive suite of diagnostic visualization functions, and a model comparison framework for rigorous evaluation of alternative model structures.
