\usage{
sim_cal(params)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A list of parameters from \code{initialize_params()}.
Must contain \code{model_type} ("age_based" or "length_based") to
determine which transition matrix to build.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{model_type}{Character: "age_based" or "length_based"}
\item{LatA}{Length-at-age vector}
\item{W_at_len}{Weight-at-length vector}
\item{mat}{Maturity-at-length vector}
\item{q_surv}{Survey catchability-at-length vector}
\item{sel}{Selectivity vector (at-age for age_based, at-length for length_based)}
\item{pla}{Age-length transition matrix (always built for initial conditions)}
\item{Gij}{Growth transition matrix (length_based only)}
\item{nlen, len_lower, len_upper}{Length bin dimensions}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates derived biological variables (length-at-age,
weight-at-length, maturity, selectivity, survey catchability) and the
appropriate transition matrix for the simulation model. For age-based
species (flatfish, krill) it builds the age-length transition matrix (pla);
for length-based species (tuna) it builds the growth transition matrix (Gij).
